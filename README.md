Matlab required

Basic Matlab program to calculate the gain of an RC circuit over a range of frequencies.

Adjust the Resistance and Capacitance values to those you wish to investigate.

Ensure you use the ohm value and not the K ohm or M ohm. Or add appropriate *10.^xx. 

Pay attention to your values for capacitance as well.

You can also change the frequency range.

Now you can compile and run the program.

Observe chart for results.
